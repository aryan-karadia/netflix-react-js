# Netflix 2.0 Clone

This Netflix clone was built using React js and Tailwind CSS, along with a Firebase backend for authentication. This taught me many things, including how to use Firebase for user authentication and storage!

This clone uses a movie API from https://www.themoviedb.org/ to get all the movie data and then dispalys it using JavaScript and CSS.

## TODO

1. Connect Firestore cloud storage for user database (favourited movies)
2. Create Account home page
