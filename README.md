# Netflix 2.0 Clone

Web App: https://netflix-clone-b8376.web.app/

This Netflix clone was built using React js and Tailwind CSS, along with a Firebase backend for authentication. The web app is also hosted through Firebase. This app taught me many things, howver the key things I have learnt are:

* Using React and Tailwind CSS to create a front-end page
* Using an API to fetch realtime data
* Using Firebase to authenticate and store users
* Creating and connecting a Firestore cloud databse
* Using Firebase to deploy a live web app

This clone uses a movie API from https://www.themoviedb.org/ to get all the movie data and then dispalys it using JavaScript and CSS.

## TODO

1. Connect Firestore cloud storage for user database (favourited movies)
2. Create Account home page
